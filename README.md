## Reading DiscussionOne article That particularly intriuged me was the one about South africa's machine learning issue with private security. The issue was with privates security teams using the dear of crime to gain a big foothold in South africa and are now placing camera's all over the place. Soon they will be usig facial recognition technology to capture potential criminals. This raises the issue of companies having collecting data that can be used against the public. People are not giving consent to being filmed or have data collected about them. While it may make the streets safer it also can be said that the companies profit off of crime. The next fear is that these copmanies start collude with the government to further control people. The question is raised " How much privacy adn freedom must people lose to be safe? and why are these the trade off?" I think these are questions we all need to ask ourselves going forward
